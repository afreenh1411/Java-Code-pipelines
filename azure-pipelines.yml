# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

# Build across multiple platforms
#strategy:
#  matrix:
#    linux:
#      imageName: "ubuntu-latest"

#      imageName: "macOS-latest"
#    windows:
#      imageName: "windows-latest"
#  maxParallel: 3
#pool:
#  vmImage: $(imageName)

# Build using different versions on single platform
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
